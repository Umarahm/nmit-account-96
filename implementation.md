```

#### 2. Database Schema Design

**Core Tables:**
- `users` - User accounts with roles
- `contacts` - Customers and vendors
- `products` - Product catalog with HSN codes
- `taxes` - Tax configurations
- `chart_of_accounts` - Accounting ledger
- `transactions` - All financial transactions
- `orders` - Purchase/Sales orders
- `invoices` - Generated invoices/bills
- `payments` - Payment records
- `reports` - Cached report data

**Key Relationships:**
- Users ↔ Contacts (one-to-many)
- Products ↔ Orders (many-to-many through order_items)
- Orders ↔ Invoices (one-to-one)
- Invoices ↔ Payments (one-to-many)

#### 3. API Architecture

**RESTful Endpoints Structure:**
```
/api
├── auth/                 # Authentication endpoints
├── users/                # User management
├── contacts/             # Contact CRUD
├── products/             # Product management with HSN
├── taxes/                # Tax configuration
├── accounts/             # Chart of accounts
├── transactions/         # Transaction processing
├── orders/               # Order management
├── invoices/             # Invoice generation
├── payments/             # Payment processing
